- [x] Add Let's Encrypt support to the api.
    - [x] HTTP-01 challenge method
    - [x] In production the domain is api.threadloaf.com
    - [x] Add Let's Encrypt credentials and configuration to .env / example.env
    - [x] Make it optional. When debugging locally we want HTTP only with Let's Encrypt functionality disabled.
    - [x] In production, our API endpoints must mandate HTTPS. If the user makes such a request via plaintext HTTP, return a 4xx error with a stern message without taking any action.
    - [x] In production, only the Let's Encrypt acme challenge endpoint should be exposed via HTTP since that is required.
    - [x] DON'T redirect from HTTP to HTTPS. Our endpoints should actually fail. Don't enable client sloppiness.
    - [x] In debug mode, Let's Encrypt is disabled and all endpoints are exposed via HTTP.
- [ ] Add an AWS terraform configuration for the api. Absolutely everything required, so it can be deployed to a fresh blank AWS account. Do not deploy it; only create the configuration in a `terraform/` folder. You can run terraform commands EXCEPT apply. 
    - [ ] us-east-1c
    - [ ] Terraform S3 backend, bucket name "threadloaf-terraform".
    - [ ] VPC
    - [ ] Parameter Store parameter for the .env file (secret). I will set the real value manually in AWS Management Console.
    - [ ] Parameter Store parameter for the URL from which to download the API release .zip (generated by our api.yml GitHub Actions workflow; not secret). I will set the real value manually in AWS Management Console.
    - [ ] IAM instance role. AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy to allow Session Manager connection. Custom policy to allow read-only access to the Parameter Store parameters.
    - [ ] Security group. expose HTTP and HTTPS ports. Do not expose SSH since we use Session Manager for side channel access to the terminal.
    - [ ] Elastic IP address
    - [ ] EC2 instance, t4g.micro, Ubuntu Arm64. Tag Name="api.threadloaf.com"
    - [ ] Use cloud-init user data to install node.js, download and extract the API release zip, write the .env file, set up a systemd service, and start the service. Our zip contains the node_modules and is ready to run.
