- [x] Add Let's Encrypt support to the api.
    - [x] HTTP-01 challenge method
    - [x] In production the domain is api.threadloaf.com
    - [x] Add Let's Encrypt credentials and configuration to .env / example.env
    - [x] Make it optional. When debugging locally we want HTTP only with Let's Encrypt functionality disabled.
    - [x] In production, our API endpoints must mandate HTTPS. If the user makes such a request via plaintext HTTP, return a 4xx error with a stern message without taking any action.
    - [x] In production, only the Let's Encrypt acme challenge endpoint should be exposed via HTTP since that is required.
    - [x] DON'T redirect from HTTP to HTTPS. Our endpoints should actually fail. Don't enable client sloppiness.
    - [x] In debug mode, Let's Encrypt is disabled and all endpoints are exposed via HTTP.
- [x] We are conditionally importing acme-client only in non-test mode in lets-encrypt.ts. This is causing endless problems. Eliminate conditional import of acme-client. Always import it. Find a different way to work around whatever issues crop up when we import acme-client in test mode. We likely want to import it for real and then mock it in tests.
- [x] Verify that no other conditional imports exist in the codebase. Then, update global.mdc to add a rule: never use conditional imports.
