# Thread list reply previews
- [ ] When a thread list is visible, show a "Refresh Previews" button to the right of the existing "Sort & View" button. Read context/THREAD_LIST_EXAMPLE.html for the HTML. The button will do the same thing that our DOM watcher's "new thread list element" event does: it collects all the visible thread IDs, issues the API call, and when the API call comes back it updates the displayed thread replies. The button itself is disabled while the API call is in flight so the user can't keep clicking it.
