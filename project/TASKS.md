- [x] The first time I open the thread list for a forum channel, our reply previews show correctly. If I switch to a chat channel and then return to the forum channel, our reply previews do not show. The reply previews never return after that. No further API calls are made. I have Dev Tools and can poke around if you need.
- [ ] *Every* time we get a (debounced) "new thread in the thread list" event, we need to send the API call for *all* visible threads. Even if we've seen them all before. Keep a cache for quick reaction so the replies appear immediately, but always update that cache from the server on this event and update the previews asynchronously when the response comes in.
