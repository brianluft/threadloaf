Run tests with `/workspaces/threadloaf/src/api/test.sh`.

If there are any failing tests, fix one.

If a passing test is printing errors to the console, make the test check for that error and fail, then fix the issue.

If all tests are OK, then investigate the first uncovered line. Add a test to cover it, or explain why it cannot be tested.
If you discover that the original code is wrong, fix the original code and then make your new test pass.

Run tests with `/workspaces/threadloaf/src/api/test.sh` again to verify your change.

IMPORTANT: make ONE change, test it successfully, and then stop. You must give me a chance to review before we proceed.
